# CSCI-SHU-360-Machine-Learning-Final-Competition-Project
The final project of CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning. Trying to train an autoencoder model for encoding and decoding while learning the image classes.

This model is tested based on:
○ Reconstruction
○ Linear probing of the bottleneck representation
○ Sampling
