# CSCI-SHU-360-Machine-Learning-Final-Competition-Project
This is the final project for CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning. The goal is to train an autoencoder model for encoding and decoding Pokémon images.

The model is evaluated on:

Reconstruction

Linear probing of the bottleneck representation

Sampling

I experimented with two model architectures: VQ-VAE and AE. In the end, I found that the AE architecture achieved very strong performance in reconstructing Pokémon images. However, for linear probing and the classification task, both models showed limited performance.
